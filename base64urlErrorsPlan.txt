The Plan

1. âœ… Modify lib/supabase.ts:
   - Added isValidBase64Url validation function
   - Implemented proper error handling for storage operations
   - Added validation before decoding
   - Unified error handling between web and native platforms
   Status: COMPLETED

2. âœ… Modify hooks/useAuth.ts:
   - Added proper error handling for all auth operations
   - Improved session management
   - Added type safety and error boundaries
   - Removed direct base64url handling (now handled by supabase client)
   Status: COMPLETED

3. âœ… Fix expo-json-file encoding issue:
   - Implement custom encoding wrapper for expo-json-file
   - Add stringification for all stored values
   - Add try/catch blocks around write operations
   - Implement fallback storage mechanism
   - Add validation before write operations
   Status: COMPLETED

4. âœ… Implement storage adapter improvements:
   - Created custom storage adapter class
   - Added proper type checking for stored values
   - Implemented proper error handling for failed operations
   - Added retry mechanism for failed operations
   Status: COMPLETED

5. âœ… Remove js-base64:
   - Removed dependency from package.json
   - Replaced base64 operations with native methods
   - Verified no remaining imports exist
   Status: COMPLETED

6. âœ… Fix Platform reference issues:
   - Added proper Platform imports
   - Fixed Platform.select() usage
   - Removed unnecessary platform-specific code
   - Added proper type checking for platform values
   Status: COMPLETED

7. ðŸ”„ Testing:
   - Test auth flow on web âœ…
   - Test auth flow on iOS (Expo Go) ðŸ”„
   - Test auth flow on Android (Expo Go) ðŸ”„
   - Test error scenarios ðŸ”„
   - Test storage operations ðŸ”„
   Status: IN PROGRESS

Current Status: Working on Step 7 (Testing)

Next Actions:
1. Complete remaining platform-specific testing
2. Document any platform-specific behaviors or limitations
3. Verify error handling across all scenarios
4. Test storage operations under network stress conditions
5. Validate auth flows with various account states
6. Create test report documenting results and any issues found
